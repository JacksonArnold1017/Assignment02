    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p><b>What do you hope to learn in your HTML/CSS course class ?</b> </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I hope to learn how to become a better developer.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I do take passion in this, because I really enjoy doing things on computers. </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I hope that one day I will be able to create my own webpages and be proud of my creations.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Making something and being proud of it, is one of my favorite things in life. So creating webpages that I enjoy is something I definitely look forward to doing.</p>
